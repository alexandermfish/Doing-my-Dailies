# Doing-my-Dailys
A bit of a variation of the typical To Do list app.  You use this to keep track of things you have to do (or more importantly; want to do) daily.  The idea is for it to be similar to daily quests in an RPG (gamification aspects) to help build or remember habits that you enjoy/need.

## Justification
My personal philosophy has led me to believe that striving to towards a goal is much more easily achieved by breaking down the task into a routine rather than a long term conclusion. 

For example, reading a book, or even creating a todo list app becomes daily tasks such as:
- read 20 pages

or
- code for 1-2 hrs.

The point of this app is to help keep track of the various daily progressions a person may wish to persue.
The gamification will allow for streaks, progress tracking and achievements as well as notifications to remind you.
Points allow for streak pauses, and routines should be customizable (ie, can be set to certain days of the week if they're not appropriate to do every day).  Garmin's excersize "connect" tracker and duolingos streaks have had a profound impact on how likely I am to keep up my progress, weirdly. It makes sense to incorporate this kind of functionality to me - for the somewhat useful functionality of it and the learning experience.


### Note
This readme is currently to serve as a very very rough design doc/inspiration - ideally I would love to create all these features, but in the mean time they are simply reminders. This app is 100% for my own purposes in the interest of self development (both by learning how to make the app and the actual usage of working versions) but feel free to use any aspect of it (once it exists).


### Usage
TODO (the irony is not lost on me)
