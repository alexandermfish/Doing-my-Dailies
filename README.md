# Doing-my-Dailys
A bit of a variation of the typical To Do list app.  You use this to keep track of things you have to do (or more importantly; want to do) daily.  The idea is for it to be similar to daily quests in an RPG (gamification aspects) to help build or remember habits that you enjoy/need.
